## Personal Statement
I am a digital media developer and interdisciplinary creative with a strong background in interactive storytelling, web development, and data visualization. My practice focuses on blending narrative, technology, and design to create immersive, user-driven experiences. Currently, I am building an interactive map app that allows users to explore locations through memories, media, and embedded routes, transforming static spaces into dynamic narratives. This project builds on my interest in how digital tools can deepen connections with physical spaces, making information, memories, and personal narratives accessible and interactive.

## Project Description
The project is an interactive, multimedia-rich map application that reimagines how users engage with university spaces. This digital platform allows users to click on various campus buildings to reveal personal memories, explore multimedia elements, and trace routes between significant locations. Each building pop-up includes descriptive text, video, music, and photos, allowing the audience to engage with spaces through more than just location. Routes between buildings showcase pathways familiar to students, and each route includes audio or video narratives to enrich the journey.

This app fosters a connection between users and the university, inviting them to re-experience or explore spaces through the lens of lived experience. It will be accessible online and potentially integrated with campus tours or historical archives, turning the app into a continuously evolving storytelling tool. This project takes the form of a digital, interactive map application, utilizing web technologies like React, Leaflet, and multimedia integrations. By blending place, memory, and media, this app creates a meaningful way for users to engage with campus spaces beyond traditional, static maps.

## Project Contribution to Wider Interests
This interactive map app aligns with my broader goals of rethinking the ways we document, share, and engage with spatial and narrative data. My work has consistently explored how digital platforms can transform physical experiences, specifically focusing on how we navigate, remember, and narrate space. This project not only strengthens my technical practice but also engages my interest in bridging digital interfaces with user-generated content, effectively democratizing access to collective and personal histories.

Through this app, I am exploring a concept I call “digital memory landscapes,” where physical spaces become canvases for individual and collective memories. By allowing users to interact with memories, sounds, and visuals associated with each location, the app emphasizes the layers of experience that make up campus life. This approach aligns with my larger creative practice of creating tools and experiences that enable people to navigate and share narratives in ways that are participatory and immersive.

Beyond technical skills, this project engages questions about space, memory, and community that are central to my creative and intellectual pursuits. I am interested in how digital tools can enhance personal connection to space, offering new ways to explore and understand environments like university campuses. This project pushes my practice forward by experimenting with the layering of media types—text, audio, and video—and developing interactivity that makes users’ experiences active rather than passive.

This project could evolve into a toolkit for communities beyond the university, enabling museums, historical sites, or neighborhoods to create their own interactive maps enriched with personal stories and multimedia. By making space for layered, multimedia narratives within a map interface, I am creating a bridge between digital media and spatial storytelling that could have broader applications in community building, memory preservation, and digital archiving. This project is not just an app but a prototype for a different way to understand and connect with physical spaces through digital tools.
